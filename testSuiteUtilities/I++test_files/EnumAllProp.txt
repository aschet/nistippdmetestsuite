EnumAllProp.txt

The EnumAllProp.prg file contains one instance of each of the 20 calls
to EnumAllProp allowed by the spec for which the response includes
data. There are 56 additional calls for properties that have no
children(such as "EnumAllProp(FoundTool.PtMeasPar.Search.Act())"
that do not return data.

Alignment, CollisionVolume, Name, and Id are not used, since
the spec allows them only with GetProp.

The EnumAllProp.res file contains the responses to the commands in
the EnumAllProp.prg file.
