numbersErrorCmd.txt

The numbersErrorCmd.prg file contains commands that have number errors.
The numbersErrorCmd.res file contains what the NIST server responds
when it is connected to the NIST client and that client runs the
numbersErrorCmd.prg file.

The rest of this file shows what the stand-alone command parser
prints when the numbersErrorCmd.prg file is run through it (with
the correct, non-number commands omitted).  The error messages explain
what is wrong with each number.
