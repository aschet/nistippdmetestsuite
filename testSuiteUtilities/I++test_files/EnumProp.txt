EnumProp.txt

The EnumProp.prg file contains one instance of each of the 76 calls
calls to EnumProp allowed by the spec.

Alignment, CollisionVolume, Name, and Id are not used, since
the spec allows them only with GetProp.

The EnumProp.res file contains the responses to the first few
commands in the EnumProp.prg file, plus the response to the
EndSession command at the end. The responses to EnumProp(Tool.GoToPar())
follow the model given in section 7.7, page 73 of the spec.
