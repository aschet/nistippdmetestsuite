SetCsyTransformation.txt

The SetCsyTransformation.prg file contains SetCsyTransformation commands,
SetCoordSystem commands, and Get commands.  When theta is 0, Psi and Phi
are both rotations about the original Z-axis, so any two settings that have
theta=0 and the same Psi+Phi produce the same effect. Thus, commands 00020
and 00030 do not change anything.

The SetCsyTransformation.res file contains responses to the commands in
The SetCsyTransformation.prg file. The values in SetCsyTransformation.res
returned in response to Get commands are actual correct values.
