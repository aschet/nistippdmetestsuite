allResOK.txt

The allResOK.res file has one response of each type. The following
functions in the parserRes.cc file make responses. The second and third
digits of the tag number correspond to the number of the function in the
list below that built the response. The fifth digit of the tag number
corresponds to first, second, etc. response made by that function.
For example, 00302 would be the tag number of the second response made by
makeEnumPropResponse.

1.  makeAlignResponse
2.  makeCenterPartResponse
3.  makeEnumPropResponse
4.  makeErrorResponse
5.  makeGetChangeToolActionResponse
6.  makeGetCoordSystemResponse
7.  makeGetCsyTransformationResponse
8.  makeGetDMEVersionResponse
9.  makeGetErrStatusEResponse
10. makeGetMachineClassResponse
11. makeGetPropResponse
12. makeIsHomedResponse
13. makeIsUserEnabledResponse
14. makeOnePropertyAlignment
15. makeOnePropertyCollisionVolume
16. makeOnePropertyId
17. makeOnePropertyName
18. makeOnePropertyNumber
19. makePtMeasOrGetResponse
20. makeScanResponse
21. makeStringResponse
22. makeTiltCenterPartResponse
23. makeTiltPartResponse

In addition to the responses made by the functions listed above,
server-initiated responses made by the following functions (in the
parserRes.cc file) are included near the end of allResOK.res. These
all use tag E0000.

makeChangeToolEResponse
makeGoToEResponse
makeKeyPressEResponse
makePtMeasEResponse
makeSetPropEResponse

The allResOK.prg file is a file of commands whose execution might result
in the responses in the allResOK.res file (except that the correct context
is not established to produce several of the responses). For the server-
initiated responses at the end of the allResOK.res file, there are no
corresponding commands in the allResOK.prg file.

The allResOK.prg and allResOK.res files should parse without error in
parserCmd and parserRes, respectively.
