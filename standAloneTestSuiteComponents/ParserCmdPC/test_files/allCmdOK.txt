allCmdOK.txt

The allCmdOK.prg file contains at least one instance of each type of I++
DME Interface version 1.4 command. All the commands in this file are
correct, and the file should execute (in simulation) without error. The
commands are arranged alphabetically (except for StopAllDaemons and
StopDaemon) and numbered 0010, 0020, 0030, etc. Other commands (whose
tag's last digit is not 0) are added so that correct execution is possible.

The file itself does nothing useful.

The allCmdOK.res file contains responses corresponding to the commands in
the allCmdOK.prg file. Actual data responses received while executing
allCmdOK.prg will differ somewhat from those in allCmdOK.res in most cases.
